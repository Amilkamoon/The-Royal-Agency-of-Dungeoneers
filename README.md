# The-Royal-Agency-of-Dungeoneers
Homebrewed Private Setting for Shadiesdash - Described as Discworld with a Cyberpunk Soul by the DM

The players (any module so long as you can give me a source idc), are Agents of R.A.D, the Royal Agency of Dungeoneers. As Royal Dungeoneers, the players job/duties are to prevent the dungeonisation of properties throughout the kingdom, as crypts, cellars, and untended properties tend to attract creatures, necromancers, and other undesirables. They also investigate the taxes of nobles to make sure they don't horde enough gold, wealth, and magic trinkets to attract the attention of dragons
